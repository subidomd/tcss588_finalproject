# TCSS 588 Final Project

In this project is my code for the TCSS 588 Final Project. I worked on parsing the original data, as well as to work over the parsed data and make classifications using k-Nearest Neighbor, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and Naive Bayes.

## Running the data parser
To run tott_data_parser.ipynb, simply place the Jupyter Notebook into the top layer of the ConsensusML project, and allow it to run. It will create three files: a parsed csv containing only AML clinical patients called AML_clinical_parsed, a parsed csv of differentially expressed genes belonging to those patients called AML_Expression_Subset_DE, and a parsed csv containing all genes belonging to those patients called AML_Expression_Subset. For your convenience, included is a copy of the files generated by tott_data_parser, so you may skip this step if you so desire.

## Running the classification methods
To run tott_aml.ipynb, place the Jupyter Notebook in the same directory as the aforementioned AML_clinical_parsed.csv, AML_Expression_Subset_DE.csv, and AML_Expression_Subset.csv files. From there, simply run the cells in order. It will take several hours to run, but once it is finished, it will create a csv file for all of the cross-validated accuracies per patient in the AML Clinical file called table.accuracy.csv. By taking the mean for each column, you will see the average accuracy for each classification method.
